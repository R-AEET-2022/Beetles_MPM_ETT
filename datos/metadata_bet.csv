H. Karst). On January 16, 2007, an area of c. 1000 ha of mature Norway spruce forests was felled by the windstorm â€˜Kyrillâ€™. From those 1000 ha, four larger patches were selected totalling about 200 ha to remain unlogged; on the remaining 800 ha, storm-felled trees were removed by experimental post-disturbance logging up to August 2007. Afterwards, 44 plots, 22 in logged areas and 22 in unlogged areas. During logging operations, branches were cut off the trunk and left on the ground, and the main trunk was removed. Following this, dead wood resources were reduced from c. 300 mÂ³/ha to c. 50 mÂ³/ha in all 22 logged areas (details in Thorn et al. 2014, 2015). This dataset is part of a multi-taxon study, where 8 different taxonomic groups were monitored across plots that had the 2 different regimes (logged VS unlogged). It consists of beetle data from logged plots.
To reflect the emerging beetle fauna of surrounding dead wood, flight-interception traps were used. Traps were established throughout windthrow centres and surrounding salvage-logged areas: 22 in logged areas and 22 in non-logged areas in spring 2008. Traps in logged areas were surrounded by at least a 50 m radius of completely salvage-logged windthrows (all trees removed); traps in non-logged areas were surrounded by at least a 50 m radius of completely non-logged windthrow (all trees of the previous stand were wind felled). Each trap consisted of a crossed pair of transparent plastic shields (40660 cm) and contained a 3.0% copper-vitriol solution to preserve trapped specimens. The shortest distance between two traps was 50 m, and the largest distance between traps was 6,500 m. Sampling was conducted during the entire growing season between May after the snow melted until September over four consecutive years until 2011. Traps were emptied monthly. All sampled beetles were identified to the species level, but only saproxylic beetles were retained.","Saproxylic beetles were trapped using flight-interception traps placed at the plot centroid from the second to the fifth year of the study period","419","541","FM biomass and depth set to zeroes from NULLs, VB split the dataset according to management measure.","Jun-21","1","Count","1","NA","7","","lat_long_plotID_year","448","Thorn, S., Bässler, C., Bernhardt-Römermann, M., Cadotte, M., Heibl, C., Schäfer, H., Seibold, S. & Müller, J.
